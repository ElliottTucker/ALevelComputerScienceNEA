A small 3D vertical platformer built with Unity. The level is procedurally generated as a sequence of platforms that ascend upwards. Every 20th platform is a bouncy booster and the final platform is a win platform. The game includes a basic save/load system, a pause menu, and UI for height progress and win state.
